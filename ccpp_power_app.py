## A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which ar## e combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. Combined Cyclic Power plant generates Electric power based on the inputs such
## hourly average ambient temperature(T) , Relative Humidity(RH) and exhaust vacuum(V). We have modelled the generation of power P which is given by
##  P = 518.4965 -2.0135*T -0.1644*RH -0.2306*V.When the user enters the values of T, V and RH in the web page , the model is accessed and the electric power P is predicted and made available to the user.
